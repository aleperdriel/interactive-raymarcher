# Interactive Raymarching Experience

Welcome to my project ! This is my first raymarching project using GLSL. This project displays a basic WebGL raymarching scene with interactive camera controls. The user can navigate the scene by panning and rotating the camera, with a 3D environment rendered using signed distance functions (SDF).

## Online Demo

You can play with this project [here](https://aleperdriel.github.io/interactive-raymarcher/)

## Features

- **Ray Marching**: Renders a 3D scene using ray marching techniques
- **Interactive Camera**: Pan the camera by dragging the mouse and rotate it by holding `Ctrl` while dragging
- **Lighting Effects**: Basic directional lighting with diffuse and specular reflections.
- **FPS Display**: Displays the frame rate in the top-left corner to monitor performances


## Setup

1. **Clone the Project**:
  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aleperdriel/interactive-raymarcher
   ```

2. **Open the Project**:
   - Open `index.html` in any modern browser that supports WebGL.
  
And here you go !

## Files

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file
- **`script.js`**: JavaScript file that handles rendering and user input
- **`shader.vert`**: Vertex shader
- **`shader.frag`**: Fragment shader


Enjoy this small experience !
